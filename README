* depends on OpenNI, NITE, SensorKinect

__________________________________________________________

::INSTALL::
tested under Ubuntu and OSX 10.6.8, should run under Windows

OSX: 
you don't have to compile the external for yourself -> use included binaries from build folder (copy pix_openni.pd_darwin in pix_openni folder)
you still need OpenNI, NITE and SensorKinect!!
* 	download latest OpenNI and NITE unstable build for OSX from http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx, 
	sudo ./install.sh in the extracted folders
*	install SensorKinect from https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect


Linux:
*	get/install pd and Gem (http://puredata.info)

*	get and install OpenNI, NITE and the hacked Primesense Kinect driver
	--> instruction: https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
	http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx

*	edit Makefile for right path to Gem, pd and OpenNI sources

*	#.../pix_openni> make

*	have a look at the pix_openni-help.pd file!

:: Usage ::

Hand Tracking:

to track multiple Hands edit following File: 
	/usr/etc/primesense/Hands_*/Nite.ini
and add or uncomment:

	[HandTrackerManager]
	AllowMultipleHands=1
	TrackAdditionalHands=1

:::THINGS TO DO:::

*	motor and led control is currently not supported from the library
	you can do that with pix_freenect

*	clean shutdown of OpenNI framework -> currently you have to kill pd

*	cpu performance optimization
