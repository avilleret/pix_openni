
pix_openni (0.11 experimenting...)
======================================
pure data / Gem external to get multiple Kinect rgb and depth streams, single device skeleton tracking and hand tracking

* depends on OpenNI, NITE, SensorKinect

2011/2012 by Matthias Kronlachner
__________________________________________________________

::INSTALL::
tested under Ubuntu, OSX 10.8.2 and Windows 7


OSX: 
you don't have to compile the external for yourself -> use included binaries from build folder (copy pix_openni.pd_darwin in pix_openni folder)
you still need OpenNI, NITE and SensorKinect!!
* 	download latest OpenNI and NITE unstable build for OSX from http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx, 
	sudo ./install.sh in the extracted folders
*	install SensorKinect from https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect


WINDOWS:
you don't have to compile the external for yourself -> use included binaries from build folder (copy pix_openni.dll in pix_openni folder)
install OpenNI, NITE and SensorKinect

http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx
(OpenNI Binaries, unstable, x86 - 32 bit)

Binary of NITE
http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx
(OepnNI Compiliant Middleware Binaries, x86 - 32 Bit)

Binary of avin2 / SensorKinect
https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/downloads
SensorKinect093-Bin-Win32-v5.1.2.1.msi


Linux:
*	get/install pd and Gem (http://puredata.info)

*	get and install OpenNI, NITE and the hacked Primesense Kinect driver
	--> instruction: https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
	http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx

*	edit Makefile for right path to Gem, pd and OpenNI sources

*	#.../pix_openni> make

*	have a look at the pix_openni-help.pd file!

:: Usage ::

*	Have a look at my pd-kinect-examples at Github: http://github.com/kronihias/pd-kinect-examples

Hand Tracking:

to track multiple Hands edit following File: 
	/usr/etc/primesense/Hands_*/Nite.ini
and add or uncomment:

	[HandTrackerManager]
	AllowMultipleHands=1
	TrackAdditionalHands=1

_________________
Changelog

0.12	* multiple Kinect support (just for rgb/depth capture, not for tracking -> OpenNI limitation!)

0.11	* improved playback/record functionality -> now it is possible to switch between live and playback
		* bugfixes

0.10	* various bugfixes
		* depth_output simplified - just rgba and yuv available ->
		* ATTENTION INCOMPABILITY: "viewable" depth output outsourced into pix_depth2rgba
		* record and playback functionality
		* user coloring
		* skeleton settable smoothing factor
		
0.03	* switchable OSC Style output of tracking data /skeleton/joint/r_hand id x y z, /hand/coords id x y z
		* switchable real-world coordinate output in [mm]
		* switchable registration between rgb image and depth image -> change point of view from depth camera to match with rgb image (overlay)
		* improved help file

0.02
		* OSX binaries
		* output rgb and depth stream simultaneously
		* hand tracking
		* change image and depth modes
		* init without .xml init file
		* fixed depth to rgb conversion for output_mode 1 & 2


0.01
		* skeleton and rgb or depth stream output

:::THINGS TO DO:::

* 	playback speed is still a mystery!


*	motor and led control as well as audio is currently not supported from SensorKinect
	you can do that with pd external freenect: http://github.com/kronihias/freenect
