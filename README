__________________________________________________________

::INSTALL::
just testet under Ubuntu but should also work in OSX and Windows


*	get/install pd and Gem (http://puredata.info)

*	get and install OpenNI, NITE and the hacked Primesense Kinect driver
	--> instruction: https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect

*	edit Makefile for right path to Gem, pd and OpenNI sources

*	#.../pix_openni> make

:: Usage ::

Hand Tracking:

to track multiple Hands edit following File: 
	/usr/etc/primesense/Hands_1_4_1/Nite.ini
and add or uncomment:

	[HandTrackerManager]
	AllowMultipleHands=1
	TrackAdditionalHands=1

:::THINGS TO DO:::

*	motor and led control is currently not supported from the library
	you can do that with pix_freenect
