* depends on OpenNI/NITE, SensorKinect

__________________________________________________________

::INSTALL::
tested under Ubuntu and OSX 10.6.8, should run under Windows

OSX: you don't have to compile it for yourself -> use included binaries from build folder
but you still need OpenNI, NITE (latest unstable build for OSX) and SensorKinect --> see below

*	get/install pd and Gem (http://puredata.info)

*	get and install OpenNI, NITE and the hacked Primesense Kinect driver
	--> instruction: https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect
	http://www.openni.org/Downloads/OpenNIModules.aspx

*	edit Makefile for right path to Gem, pd and OpenNI sources

*	#.../pix_openni> make

*	have a look at the pix_openni-help.pd file!

:: Usage ::

Hand Tracking:

to track multiple Hands edit following File: 
	/usr/etc/primesense/Hands_1_4_1/Nite.ini
and add or uncomment:

	[HandTrackerManager]
	AllowMultipleHands=1
	TrackAdditionalHands=1

_________________
Changelog

0.02
	* output rgb and depth stream
	* hand tracking
	* change image and depth modes
	* init without .xml init file
	* fixed depth to rgb conversion for output_mode 1 & 2


0.01
	* skeleton and rgb or depth stream output

 ________________
:::THINGS TO DO:::

*	motor and led control is currently not supported from the library
	you can do that with pix_freenect

*	clean shutdown of OpenNI framework -> currently you have to kill pd

*	cpu performance optimization
